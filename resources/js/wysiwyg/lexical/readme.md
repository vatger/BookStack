# Lexical Editor Framework

This is a fork and import of [the Lexical editor](https://lexical.dev/) at the version of v0.17.1 for direct use and modification in BookStack. This was done due to fighting many of the opinionated defaults in Lexical during editor development.

Only components used, or intended to be used, were copied in at this point.
